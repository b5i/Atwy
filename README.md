## Known Issues
- Videos that have more than one audio track (multiple languages) aren't played in the right language.
- The elliplis button in the full-thumbnail video view (`VideoView2`) starts playing the video in addition to show a context menu.
- (InfiniteScrollViews) Menus containing an `ElementsInfiniteScrollView` with very few elements have unexpected behaviors.
- Downloaded videos can appear two times in the `Downloads` section.

### Note
At this time, Atwy is still in a very early stage with a lot improvements, refractoring and bug fixes still to come.
